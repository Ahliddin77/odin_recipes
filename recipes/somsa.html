    <h3>What is Somsa ?</h3>
    <p>The Central Asian region is located in the middle of the Silk Road and historically, was a place where a lot of merchants and traders passed by. 
        <br>And since people didn’t have motorized vehicles and jetplanes back then, they needed a snack that they could take with them on a long journey that can be eaten both,
        hot and cold, and be equally tasty. <br>This is where samsa enters the story. 
        It’s a great, nutritious, and filling snack that can endure the hot weather and can be just as delicious even after a few days of its preparation.</p>
